## 1. Computational Thinking

> **Computer programming** is about taking some input and producing some output - solving a problem.

## Binary

- Computer only understands 0 and 1. So, we need to convert decimal to binary.

### 1) Bit

- A bit is a single 0 or 1.

### 2) Byte

- A byte is 8 bits.

## 2. Presentation of Data

> Same data, different representation

### 1) Text

1. ASCII

   - ASCII(American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a standard that maps numbers to characters. For example, 65 is A, 66 is B, 97 is a, 98 is b.

2. Unicode

   - More characters than ASCII. For example, 65 is A, 66 is B, 97 is a, 98 is b, 128512 is üòê.

### 2) Image, Audio, Video

- Pixel, RGB

  - Pixel is a single dot in an image.
  - RGB is a way to represent colors. For example, 255, 0, 0 is red, 0, 255, 0 is green, 0, 0, 255 is blue.

## 3. Algorithms

### 1) Algorithm

- We can solve same problem in different ways.
- We can compare methods by using **Big O notation**.

### 2) Pseudocode

- _Human-readable_ description of an algorithm

## 4. Scratch

### 1) Scratch

- Visual programming language

### 2) Abstraction

- Abstraction is the process of taking something complicated and simplifying it so that it's easier to work with.
